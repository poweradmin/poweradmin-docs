### Attribution Policy

All meaningful contributions are credited in release notes. Please note:

- Sometimes similar ideas come from multiple contributors; implementation quality determines which is merged
- Contributions may be partially accepted or rewritten to maintain project consistency

If you notice your contribution hasn't been acknowledged in the release notes, please reach out - we want to ensure everyone receives proper recognition.

## Internationalization
- Translation files are in the `locale/` directory
- New strings should be wrapped in `_()` for translation

## Security Considerations
- Always validate user input
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use CSRF tokens for forms
