## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
2. **Backup your files and database before proceeding** - this is especially important for a major version upgrade
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Run the database migration (see Database Schema Updates section below)
5. Migrate your configuration (see Configuration Changes section below)

## Configuration Migration

### Automatic Migration (Recommended)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Poweradmin (pre-4.0.0), use the automatic migration script:

```bash
php scripts/migrate-config.php
```

This will convert your old `inc/config.inc.php` settings to the new `config/settings.php` format.

### Configuration Changes Overview

| Aspect | Old (pre-4.0.0) | New (4.0.0+) |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Location** | `inc/config.inc.php` | `config/settings.php` |
| **Format** | Direct variable assignments | Structured array format |

#### Configuration Format Examples

**Old Format (pre-4.0.0):**
```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'poweradmin';
$db_pass = 'password';
$db_name = 'powerdns';
$db_type = 'mysql';
```

**New Format (4.0.0+):**
```php
return [
    'database' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'user' => 'poweradmin',
        'password' => 'password',
        'name' => 'powerdns',
        'type' => 'mysql',
    ],
];
```

### Manual Migration Steps

If the automatic migration script doesn't work for your setup:

1. Create a new `config/settings.php` file
2. Refer to `config/settings.defaults.php` for available options
3. Map your old settings to the new format using the examples above
4. Test the configuration thoroughly

## Database Schema Updates

Version 4.0.0 introduces significant database schema changes including multiple new tables for enhanced security, API management, user preferences, and multi-factor authentication.

### New Tables Added in v4.0.0

* `login_attempts` - Login attempt tracking for security
* `migrations` - Database migration tracking
* `api_keys` - API access management  
* `user_mfa` - Multi-factor authentication support
* `user_preferences` - User preferences and settings
* `zone_template_sync` - Zone template synchronization
* `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality
* `user_agreements` - User agreement tracking

### Database Migration Files

**Important**: Instead of running individual SQL statements, use the dedicated migration files from the Poweradmin repository:

**MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
psql -U [username] -d [database_name] -f sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**SQLite:**
```bash
sqlite3 [database_file] < sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

### Migration Prerequisites and Upgrading from Older Versions

**Important**: If you're upgrading from a version earlier than v3.9.0, you must upgrade incrementally:

1. **From v2.x.x**: First upgrade to v3.0.0 (see [v3.0.0 upgrade guide](v3.0.0.md))
2. **From v3.0.x to v3.1.x**: Upgrade to v3.2.0 (see [v3.2.0 upgrade guide](v3.2.0.md))  
3. **From v3.2.x to v3.8.x**: Upgrade to v3.9.0 (see [v3.9.0 upgrade guide](v3.9.0.md))
4. **From v3.9.x**: Follow this guide to upgrade to v4.0.0

This incremental approach ensures all database migrations are applied correctly and configurations are properly migrated.

### Verify Database Migration Completeness

After running the migration, verify your database contains all 8 new tables:

**Verification Query (MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name' 
AND TABLE_NAME IN ('migrations', 'login_attempts', 'api_keys', 'user_mfa', 'user_preferences', 'zone_template_sync', 'password_reset_tokens', 'user_agreements');
```

**Expected Result:** You should see all 8 tables listed in the "New Tables Added in v4.0.0" section above.

If any tables are missing, the migration may have failed. Check the migration logs for errors.

## New Feature: DNS Record Type Customization

Version 4.0.0 introduces the ability to customize which DNS record types are available in the interface. This feature helps simplify the user interface by showing only the record types that are relevant to your specific DNS needs.

To configure this feature, add the following to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'dns' => [
    // Other DNS settings...
    
    // Record Type Settings
    'domain_record_types' => ['A', 'AAAA', 'CNAME', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA', 'TXT'], // For forward zones
    'reverse_record_types' => ['PTR', 'NS', 'SOA'],                            // For reverse zones
]
```

For full documentation on this feature, see [Record Type Customization](../configuration/record-types.md).
