# Upgrading to Version 4.0.0

## Overview

Version 4.0.0 represents a major update to Poweradmin with significant architectural improvements, enhanced security features, and a new configuration system. This guide will help you migrate from older versions.

## Key Changes

- Configuration file format and location have changed
- Database schema updates including 8 new tables for enhanced functionality
- New theming system with light/dark mode support
- Enhanced security with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Advanced account lockout and password reset features
- API key management system
- User preferences and agreements system
- Google reCAPTCHA integration
- WHOIS and RDAP lookup functionality
- Enhanced email system with multiple transport options
- Improved object-oriented architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
2. **Backup your files and database before proceeding** - this is especially important for a major version upgrade
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Run the database migration (see Database Schema Updates section below)
5. Migrate your configuration (see Configuration Changes section below)

## Configuration Migration

### Automatic Migration (Recommended)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Poweradmin (pre-4.0.0), use the automatic migration script:

```bash
php config/migrate-config.php
```

This will convert your old `inc/config.inc.php` settings to the new `config/settings.php` format.

### Post-Migration Cleanup

After successfully running the migration script and verifying your new configuration works:

1. **If you answered "y" to rename the old config during migration:**
   - The script renamed `inc/config.inc.php` to `inc/config.inc.php.bak`
   - Keep this backup temporarily while testing
   - Delete it once you're confident everything works: `rm inc/config.inc.php.bak`

2. **If you kept the original file (answered "n"):**
   ```bash
   # Backup and remove the old config
   mv inc/config.inc.php inc/config.inc.php.backup
   # Store it safely outside the web root
   mv inc/config.inc.php.backup ~/poweradmin-backups/config.inc.php.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

3. **Clean up other legacy files:**
   - You can safely remove `.old`, `.bak`, or other backup files from the `inc/` directory
   - These are typically leftover from previous installations

**Important:** Having both `inc/config.inc.php` and `config/settings.php` active can cause conflicts. The application may read outdated settings from the legacy file (e.g., removed themes), leading to errors. Remove or rename the old configuration file after confirming migration was successful.

### Configuration Changes Overview

| Aspect | Old (pre-4.0.0) | New (4.0.0+) |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Location** | `inc/config.inc.php` | `config/settings.php` |
| **Format** | Direct variable assignments | Structured array format |

#### Configuration Format Examples

**Old Format (pre-4.0.0):**
```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'poweradmin';
$db_pass = 'password';
$db_name = 'powerdns';
$db_type = 'mysql';
```

**New Format (4.0.0+):**
```php
return [
    'database' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'user' => 'poweradmin',
        'password' => 'password',
        'name' => 'powerdns',
        'type' => 'mysql',
    ],
];
```

### Manual Migration Steps

If the automatic migration script doesn't work for your setup:

1. Create a new `config/settings.php` file
2. Refer to `config/settings.defaults.php` for available options
3. Map your old settings to the new format using the examples above
4. Test the configuration thoroughly

## Database Schema Updates

Version 4.0.0 introduces significant database schema changes including multiple new tables for enhanced security, API management, user preferences, and multi-factor authentication.

### New Tables Added in v4.0.0

- `login_attempts` - Login attempt tracking for security
- `migrations` - Database migration tracking
- `api_keys` - API access management
- `user_mfa` - Multi-factor authentication support
- `user_preferences` - User preferences and settings
- `zone_template_sync` - Zone template synchronization
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality
- `user_agreements` - User agreement tracking

### Database Migration Files

**Important**: Instead of running individual SQL statements, use the dedicated migration files from the Poweradmin repository:

**MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
psql -U [username] -d [database_name] -f sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**SQLite:**
```bash
sqlite3 [database_file] < sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

### Migration Prerequisites and Upgrading from Older Versions

**Important**: If you're upgrading from a version earlier than v3.9.0, you must upgrade incrementally:

1. **From v2.x.x**: First upgrade to v3.0.0 (see [v3.0.0 upgrade guide](v3.0.0.md))
2. **From v3.0.x to v3.1.x**: Upgrade to v3.2.0 (see [v3.2.0 upgrade guide](v3.2.0.md))  
3. **From v3.2.x to v3.8.x**: Upgrade to v3.9.0 (see [v3.9.0 upgrade guide](v3.9.0.md))
4. **From v3.9.x**: Follow this guide to upgrade to v4.0.0

This incremental approach ensures all database migrations are applied correctly and configurations are properly migrated.

### Verify Database Migration Completeness

After running the migration, verify your database contains all 8 new tables:

**Verification Query (MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name' 
AND TABLE_NAME IN ('migrations', 'login_attempts', 'api_keys', 'user_mfa', 'user_preferences', 'zone_template_sync', 'password_reset_tokens', 'user_agreements');
```

**Expected Result:** You should see all 8 tables listed in the "New Tables Added in v4.0.0" section above.

If any tables are missing, the migration may have failed. Check the migration logs for errors.

## New Feature: DNS Record Type Customization

Version 4.0.0 introduces the ability to customize which DNS record types are available in the interface. This feature helps simplify the user interface by showing only the record types that are relevant to your specific DNS needs.

To configure this feature, add the following to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'dns' => [
    // Other DNS settings...
    
    // Record Type Settings
    'domain_record_types' => ['A', 'AAAA', 'CNAME', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA', 'TXT'], // For forward zones
    'reverse_record_types' => ['PTR', 'NS', 'SOA'],                            // For reverse zones
]
```

For full documentation on this feature, see [Record Type Customization](../configuration/record-types.md).

## Notes

- **Legacy configuration cleanup required**: After migrating to the new configuration format, remove or rename `inc/config.inc.php` to prevent conflicts
- Legacy configuration format (`inc/config.inc.php`) is supported in v4.0.0 but **will be completely removed in the next major release**
- Having both configuration files active can cause unexpected behavior (e.g., crashes from removed theme references)
- The new configuration system offers more flexibility and better organization
- Review security settings after upgrade to take advantage of new account lockout features
- This is a significant update that lays groundwork for future improvements
- Consider testing in a staging environment before applying to production
