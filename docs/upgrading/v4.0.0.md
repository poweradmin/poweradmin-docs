# Upgrading to Version 4.0.0

## Overview

Version 4.0.0 represents a major update to Poweradmin with significant architectural improvements, enhanced security features, and a new configuration system. This guide will help you migrate from older versions.

## Key Changes

* Configuration file format and location have changed
* Database schema updates including 8 new tables for enhanced functionality
* New theming system with light/dark mode support
* Enhanced security with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Advanced account lockout and password reset features
* API key management system
* User preferences and agreements system
* Google reCAPTCHA integration
* WHOIS and RDAP lookup functionality
* Enhanced email system with multiple transport options
* Improved object-oriented architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
2. **Backup your files and database before proceeding** - this is especially important for a major version upgrade
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Run the database migration (see Database Schema Updates section below)
5. Migrate your configuration (see Configuration Changes section below)

## Migrating from Legacy Configuration

If you're upgrading from an older version of Poweradmin (pre-4.0.0), you need to migrate your legacy configuration:

```bash
php scripts/migrate-config.php
```

This will convert your old `inc/config.inc.php` settings to the new `config/settings.php` format.

## Configuration Changes

### Old Configuration Location
`inc/config.inc.php`

### New Configuration Location
`config/settings.php`

### Configuration Format

The configuration format has changed from direct variable assignments to a structured array format:

#### Old Format (pre-4.0.0)
```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'poweradmin';
$db_pass = 'password';
$db_name = 'powerdns';
$db_type = 'mysql';
```

#### New Format (4.0.0+)
```php
return [
    'database' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'user' => 'poweradmin',
        'password' => 'password',
        'name' => 'powerdns',
        'type' => 'mysql',
    ],
];
```

## Manual Migration Steps

If the automatic migration script doesn't work for your setup, follow these steps:

1. Create a new `config/settings.php` file
2. Refer to `config/settings.defaults.php` for available options
3. Map your old settings to the new format
4. Test the configuration

## Database Schema Updates

Version 4.0.0 introduces significant database schema changes including multiple new tables for enhanced security, API management, user preferences, and multi-factor authentication.

### New Tables Added in v4.0.0

* `login_attempts` - Login attempt tracking for security
* `migrations` - Database migration tracking
* `api_keys` - API access management  
* `user_mfa` - Multi-factor authentication support
* `user_preferences` - User preferences and settings
* `zone_template_sync` - Zone template synchronization
* `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality
* `user_agreements` - User agreement tracking

### Database Migration Files

**Important**: Instead of running individual SQL statements, use the dedicated migration files from the Poweradmin repository:

**MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
psql -U [username] -d [database_name] -f sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**SQLite:**
```bash
sqlite3 [database_file] < sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

### Migration Prerequisites

**Note**: Users upgrading from versions earlier than v3.9.0 should first upgrade to v3.9.0 and run those migrations before upgrading to v4.0.0.

### Verify Database Migration Completeness

After running the migration, verify your database has all required tables for v4.0.0:

After running the migration, verify your database contains all 8 new tables listed in the "New Tables Added in v4.0.0" section above.

**Verification Query (MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name' 
AND TABLE_NAME IN ('migrations', 'login_attempts', 'api_keys', 'user_mfa', 'user_preferences', 'zone_template_sync', 'password_reset_tokens', 'user_agreements');
```

**Expected Result:** You should see all 8 new tables listed above.

If any new tables are missing, the migration may have failed. Check the migration logs for errors.

### Upgrading from Older Versions

If you're upgrading from a version earlier than v3.9.0, you should upgrade incrementally:

1. **From v2.x.x**: First upgrade to v3.0.0 (see [v3.0.0 upgrade guide](v3.0.0.md))
2. **From v3.0.x to v3.1.x**: Upgrade to v3.2.0 (see [v3.2.0 upgrade guide](v3.2.0.md))  
3. **From v3.2.x to v3.8.x**: Upgrade to v3.9.0 (see [v3.9.0 upgrade guide](v3.9.0.md))
4. **From v3.9.x**: Follow this guide to upgrade to v4.0.0

This incremental approach ensures all database migrations are applied correctly and configurations are properly migrated.

## New Feature: DNS Record Type Customization

Version 4.0.0 introduces the ability to customize which DNS record types are available in the interface. This feature helps simplify the user interface by showing only the record types that are relevant to your specific DNS needs.

To configure this feature, add the following to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'dns' => [
    // Other DNS settings...
    
    // Record Type Settings
    'domain_record_types' => ['A', 'AAAA', 'CNAME', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA', 'TXT'], // For forward zones
    'reverse_record_types' => ['PTR', 'NS', 'SOA'],                            // For reverse zones
]
```

For full documentation on this feature, see [Record Type Customization](../configuration/record-types.md).
