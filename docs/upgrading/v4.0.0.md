# Upgrading to Version 4.0.0

## Overview

Version 4.0.0 represents a major update to Poweradmin with significant architectural improvements, enhanced security features, and a new configuration system. This guide will help you migrate from older versions.

## Key Changes

- Configuration file format and location have changed
- Database schema updates including new login_attempts table
- New theming system
- Updated permission system
- Enhanced security with account lockout features
- Customizable DNS record types
- Improved object-oriented architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
2. **Backup your files and database before proceeding** - this is especially important for a major version upgrade
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Run the database migration (see Database Schema Updates section below)
5. Migrate your configuration (see Configuration Changes section below)

## Migrating from Legacy Configuration

If you're upgrading from an older version of Poweradmin (pre-4.0.0), you need to migrate your legacy configuration:

```bash
php scripts/migrate-config.php
```

This will convert your old `inc/config.inc.php` settings to the new `config/settings.php` format.

## Configuration Changes

### Old Configuration Location
`inc/config.inc.php`

### New Configuration Location
`config/settings.php`

### Configuration Format

The configuration format has changed from direct variable assignments to a structured array format:

#### Old Format (pre-4.0.0)
```php
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'poweradmin';
$db_pass = 'password';
$db_name = 'powerdns';
$db_type = 'mysql';
```

#### New Format (4.0.0+)
```php
return [
    'database' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'user' => 'poweradmin',
        'password' => 'password',
        'name' => 'powerdns',
        'type' => 'mysql',
    ],
];
```

## Manual Migration Steps

If the automatic migration script doesn't work for your setup, follow these steps:

1. Create a new `config/settings.php` file
2. Refer to `config/settings.defaults.php` for available options
3. Map your old settings to the new format
4. Test the configuration

## Database Schema Updates

Version 4.0.0 introduces significant database schema changes including multiple new tables for enhanced security, API management, user preferences, and multi-factor authentication.

### New Tables Added in v4.0.0

- `login_attempts` - Login attempt tracking for security
- `migrations` - Database migration tracking
- `api_keys` - API access management  
- `user_mfa` - Multi-factor authentication support
- `user_preferences` - User preferences and settings
- `zone_template_sync` - Zone template synchronization
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality
- `user_agreements` - User agreement tracking

### Database Migration Files

**Important**: Instead of running individual SQL statements, use the dedicated migration files from the Poweradmin repository:

**MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-mysql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
psql -U [username] -d [database_name] -f sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-pgsql-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

**SQLite:**
```bash
sqlite3 [database_file] < sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql
```
Download: [poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/blob/master/sql/poweradmin-sqlite-update-to-4.0.0.sql)

### Migration Prerequisites

**Note**: Users upgrading from versions earlier than v3.9.0 should first upgrade to v3.9.0 and run those migrations before upgrading to v4.0.0.

### Verify Database Migration Completeness

After running the migration, verify your database has all required tables for v4.0.0:

**Core Tables (should exist from previous versions):**
- `users`, `zones`, `zone_templ`, `zone_templ_records`
- `log_users`, `log_zones` (added in v3.2.0)
- `records_zone_templ` (added in v2.1.7)

**New Tables for v4.0.0:**
- `login_attempts` - Login tracking for security
- `migrations` - Database migration tracking
- `api_keys` - API access management  
- `user_mfa` - Multi-factor authentication support
- `user_preferences` - User preferences and settings
- `zone_template_sync` - Zone template synchronization
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password reset functionality
- `user_agreements` - User agreement tracking

**Verification Query (MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name' 
AND TABLE_NAME IN ('users', 'zones', 'zone_templ', 'zone_templ_records', 'log_users', 'log_zones', 'records_zone_templ', 'migrations', 'login_attempts', 'api_keys', 'user_mfa', 'user_preferences', 'zone_template_sync', 'password_reset_tokens', 'user_agreements');
```

**Expected Result:** You should see all 16 tables listed above.

If any core tables are missing, you may need to run previous version migrations first.

### Upgrading from Older Versions

If you're upgrading from a version earlier than v3.9.0, you should upgrade incrementally:

1. **From v2.x.x**: First upgrade to v3.0.0 (see [v3.0.0 upgrade guide](v3.0.0.md))
2. **From v3.0.x to v3.1.x**: Upgrade to v3.2.0 (see [v3.2.0 upgrade guide](v3.2.0.md))  
3. **From v3.2.x to v3.8.x**: Upgrade to v3.9.0 (see [v3.9.0 upgrade guide](v3.9.0.md))
4. **From v3.9.x**: Follow this guide to upgrade to v4.0.0

This incremental approach ensures all database migrations are applied correctly and configurations are properly migrated.

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

1. Check for any new required settings
2. Test functionality thoroughly
3. Update custom scripts that might reference the old configuration format

## New Feature: DNS Record Type Customization

Version 4.0.0 introduces the ability to customize which DNS record types are available in the interface. This feature helps simplify the user interface by showing only the record types that are relevant to your specific DNS needs.

To configure this feature, add the following to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'dns' => [
    // Other DNS settings...
    
    // Record Type Settings
    'domain_record_types' => ['A', 'AAAA', 'CNAME', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA', 'TXT'], // For forward zones
    'reverse_record_types' => ['PTR', 'NS', 'SOA'],                            // For reverse zones
]
```

For full documentation on this feature, see [Record Type Customization](../configuration/record-types.md).

## Enhanced Security with Account Lockout

Version 4.0.0 includes a new security feature to protect against brute force attacks:

- Login attempt tracking system with database support (using the new login_attempts table)
- Configurable account lockout after failed login attempts
- IP address-based tracking and lockouts
- Whitelist and blacklist support for IP addresses (includes CIDR support)

To configure these security features, add the following to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'security' => [
    // Maximum number of failed attempts before lockout
    'max_login_attempts' => 5,
    
    // Time window in minutes for counting failed attempts
    'login_attempt_timeframe' => 30,
    
    // Lockout duration in minutes after max failed attempts
    'lockout_duration' => 30,
    
    // IP address whitelist (never locked out)
    'ip_whitelist' => ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.1.0/24'],
    
    // IP address blacklist (always blocked)
    'ip_blacklist' => [],
],
```

## Notes

- Legacy configuration format (`inc/config.inc.php`) is still supported but will be removed in a future version
- You can have both configuration files during the transition period
- The new configuration system offers more flexibility and better organization
- Review security settings after upgrade to take advantage of new account lockout features
- This is a significant update that lays groundwork for future improvements
- Consider testing in a staging environment before applying to production

For detailed information about all new settings and options, refer to `config/settings.defaults.php` which contains comprehensive documentation in comments.
