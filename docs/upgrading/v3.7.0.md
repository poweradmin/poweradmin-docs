# Upgrading to v3.7.0

## Overview

Version 3.7.0 introduces significant improvements to PowerAdmin's DNSSEC management capabilities through integration with the PowerDNS API. This update modernizes DNSSEC operations, moving away from command-line tools to a more reliable and secure API-based approach.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v3.7.0)
2. Backup your files and database before proceeding
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Restore your configuration file (`config/settings.php`) from backup
5. Add the following new configuration options to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'pdns_api' => [
    'url' => '',  // PowerDNS API URL, e.g., 'http://127.0.0.1:8081'
    'key' => '',  // PowerDNS API key
],
```

## PowerDNS API Setup

To use the new API-based DNSSEC management:

1. Configure your PowerDNS server to enable the API:
   - Edit your PowerDNS configuration (typically `/etc/powerdns/pdns.conf`)
   - Set `api=yes` to enable the API
   - Set `api-key=your-secret-key` to secure the API
   - Configure `webserver-address` and `webserver-port` as needed
   - Restart PowerDNS to apply changes

2. Add the API details to your PowerAdmin configuration:
   - Set the URL to your PowerDNS API (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8081`)
   - Set the API key to match the one configured in PowerDNS

## New Features and Improvements

### PowerDNS API Integration
- Modern API-based management of DNSSEC operations
- More reliable and secure than command-line based approach
- Better error handling and feedback for DNSSEC operations
- Enhanced compatibility with newer versions of PowerDNS
- Support for remote PowerDNS servers (not just local instances)

### DNSSEC Management Improvements
- Improved key management interface
- Better visualization of DNSSEC signing status
- Enhanced error reporting for DNSSEC operations
- More reliable key rotation and management
- Simplified setup and configuration process

### User Interface Enhancements
- Improved DNSSEC management screens
- Better feedback for DNSSEC operations
- Enhanced zone listing with more detailed DNSSEC status
- More intuitive DNSSEC setup workflow

### Security Improvements
- More secure approach to DNSSEC management using API authentication
- Reduced reliance on command-line tools and system permissions
- Better isolation between PowerAdmin and PowerDNS server
- Enhanced input validation for DNSSEC operations

## Additional Fixes
- Fixed various bugs and issues from v3.6.1
- Improved browser compatibility
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Fixed UI rendering issues in various sections
- Performance improvements for common operations
- Updated third-party dependencies to latest secure versions

## Notes

- No database schema changes are required for this update
- The older command-line based DNSSEC management will still work if you don't configure the API
- Using the PowerDNS API is strongly recommended for better security and reliability
- Review your firewall settings if using a remote PowerDNS server to ensure API access
- This update significantly improves DNSSEC management but requires PowerDNS to be configured for API access
