# Upgrading to v3.9.0

## Overview

Version 3.9.0 introduces several significant improvements to PowerAdmin, including enhanced security with token validation, flexible UI configuration options, improved record comments functionality, and a more robust logging system. This update also includes a database schema change to support longer content in zone template records.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v3.9.0)
2. Backup your files and database before proceeding
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. Restore your configuration file (`config/settings.php`) from backup
5. Update your database schema based on the database system you're using:

### MySQL
```sql
ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records MODIFY COLUMN content varchar(2048) NOT NULL;
```

### PostgreSQL
```sql
ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records ALTER COLUMN content TYPE varchar(2048), ALTER COLUMN content SET NOT NULL;
```

### SQLite
```sql
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE zone_templ_records_new (
    "id"            integer NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "zone_templ_id" integer NOT NULL,
    "name"          text    NOT NULL,
    "type"          text    NOT NULL,
    "content"       text(2048) NOT NULL,
    "ttl"           integer NOT NULL,
    "prio"          integer NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO zone_templ_records_new SELECT * FROM zone_templ_records;
DROP TABLE zone_templ_records;
ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records_new RENAME TO zone_templ_records;
COMMIT;
```

6. Add the following new configuration options to your `config/settings.php` file:

```php
'security' => [
    // ... existing security configuration ...
    'login_token_validation' => true,        // Enable token validation for login form
    'global_token_validation' => true,       // Enable token validation for all forms
],

'interface' => [
    // ... existing interface configuration ...
    'show_record_id' => true,             // Show record ID column in edit mode
    'position_record_form_top' => false,  // Position the "Add record" form at the top of the page
    'position_save_button_top' => false,  // Position the "Save changes" button at the top of the page
    'show_record_comments' => false,      // Show or hide record comments
],

'logging' => [
    // ... existing logging configuration ...
    'type' => 'null',                     // Options: 'null', 'native'
    'level' => 'info',                    // Options: 'debug', 'info', 'notice', 'warning', 'error', 'critical', 'alert', 'emergency'
],

'misc' => [
    // ... existing misc configuration ...
    'record_comments_sync' => false,      // Enable bidirectional comment sync between A and PTR records
],
```

## New Features and Improvements

### Enhanced Security
- Added CSRF token validation for login forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
- Added option to enable token validation for all forms throughout the application
- Improved security against common web vulnerabilities
- Enhanced protection against form-based attacks

### Flexible UI Configuration
- Option to show record ID column in edit mode for easier reference
- Configurable position for record add form (top or bottom of page)
- Configurable position for save buttons (top or bottom of page)
- Option to show or hide record comments in the interface
- Better customization of the user experience for different workflows

### Record Comment Management
- Added support for bidirectional synchronization of comments between A/AAAA and PTR records
- When enabled, editing a comment on an A/AAAA record automatically updates the corresponding PTR record comment
- Likewise, editing a PTR record comment updates the associated A/AAAA record comment
- Improved visibility and management of DNS record documentation

### Improved Logging System
- Implemented a more robust logging system with configurable log types
- Added support for different log levels (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency)
- Null logger for minimal performance impact when logging is not needed
- Native logger for more detailed logging capabilities
- PSR-3 compatible logging interface for better integration with monitoring tools

### Database Improvements
- Expanded zone template record content field to support longer record values (2048 characters)
- Better support for complex record types like TXT records with lengthy content
- Improved handling of DNSSEC-related records

## Additional Enhancements
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Updated third-party dependencies to latest secure versions
- Improved browser compatibility

## Notes

- Database schema changes are required for this update - make sure to run the appropriate SQL commands
- All new configuration options have sensible defaults if not specified
- The record comments synchronization feature is disabled by default
- Token validation is enabled by default for better security
- If you've customized any templates, review them after the upgrade as some interface elements may have changed
