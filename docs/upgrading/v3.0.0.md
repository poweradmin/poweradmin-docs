# Upgrading to v3.0.0

## Overview

Version 3.0.0 is a major release that introduces significant architectural changes, modernizing the Poweradmin codebase and enhancing security, usability, and performance. This upgrade requires careful attention due to substantial changes in the application structure.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Download latest tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
2. **Make a full backup** of your files and database before proceeding
3. Replace all files with content from the downloaded archive
4. **Important**: Your old configuration file (inc/config.inc.php) will **not** be compatible with v3.0.0
5. Create a new configuration file at `config/settings.php` using the provided `config/settings.defaults.php` as a template
6. Transfer your old configuration values from `inc/config.inc.php` to the new format in `config/settings.php`
7. Update database structure:

### MySQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE `log_users` (
    `id`         int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `event`      varchar(2048) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` timestamp     NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
    `priority`   int(11) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE `log_zones` (
    `id`         int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `event`      varchar(2048) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` timestamp     NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
    `priority`   int(11) NOT NULL,
    `zone_id`    int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

### PostgreSQL and SQLite
Similar tables need to be created for PostgreSQL and SQLite databases. See the SQL files in the `sql/` directory for the exact syntax.

## Major Changes

### Architecture
- Completely refactored codebase with modern MVC architecture
- Adopted PSR-4 autoloading and PHP namespaces
- Implemented dependency injection for better maintainability
- Added Twig templating engine for views
- New routing system with controller-based request handling

### Configuration
- New structured configuration format in `config/settings.php`
- Enhanced security options including password policies
- Default password encryption changed to bcrypt
- Session security improvements with token validation

### Features
- New logging system with database support
- Two display options for index page: cards or list view
- Improved DNSSEC support and management
- Enhanced database logging for zone and record changes
- Improved user interface and experience

## Breaking Changes

1. **Configuration Format**: The configuration format has changed completely. You must manually transfer your settings to the new format.

2. **File Structure**: The application file structure has been reorganized:
   - `inc/` directory is mostly deprecated
   - New `lib/` directory contains application code
   - New `config/` directory holds configuration files
   - Templates moved to `templates/` directory

3. **Password Encryption**: Default encryption method changed to bcrypt. Existing passwords will continue to work but new passwords will use the new method.

4. **Custom Themes/Templates**: If you had custom templates, they need to be redone for the new templating system.

## Notes

- This is a major version upgrade that includes substantial changes to the codebase
- Plan for adequate testing time before deploying to production
- For complex installations, consider setting up a test environment first
- Review all configuration options carefully to ensure secure settings
